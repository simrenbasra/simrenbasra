## üîç Projects

### [Project 1: Sign-Lingual - ASL Machine Learning Interpreter](https://github.com/simrenbasra/Sign_Lingual)
- **Description**: Developed a machine learning interpreter for American Sign Language (ASL). The project involves training and evaluating various models including Logistic Regression (with and without feature extraction), CNNs and Transfer Learning approaches like VGG-16 and ResNet-50, using both the MNIST dataset and real-world images.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Streamlit.
- **Highlights**:
  - Transfer Learning: Implemented VGG-16 and ResNet-50 to leverage pre-learnt feautures.
  - Model Comparison: Evaluated different models including Logistic Regression, CNNs, and Transfer Learning techniques to determine the most effective approach.
  - Data Augmentation: Enhanced model robustness by introducing noise and variability into the dataset.
  - Real-World Testing: Assessed models on images captured from real-world images using Teachable Machine.

### [Project 2: TimeSeries Forecasting of Microsoft Stock](https://github.com/simrenbasra/timeseries)
- **Description**: Developed a timeseries forecasting model for Microsoft stock prices using both baseline and advanced methods. The project includes data preprocessing, model implementation and evaluation using timeseries cross-validation.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, statsmodels, pmdarima, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Applied multiple forecasting models from baseline methods to exponential smoothing models to more advanced models like ARIMA.
  - Incorporated exogenous variables such as interest rates and trading volume into the SARIMAX model.
  - Used timeseries cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

### [Project 3: Sound-Decisions - Headphone Recommender](https://github.com/simrenbasra/sound-decisions)
- **Description**: Developed a hybrid recommender system for headphones using scraped data from Amazon. The recommender system uses both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to provide personalised headphone recommendations.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Streamlit
- **Highlights**:
  - Performed web scraping on Amazon headphone prodcuts, only scraping data eligible by insepcting the robots.txt file.
  - Carried out feature extraciton from product descriptions to enrich the dataset.
  - Designed and implemented a hybrid recommender system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering appraoches.
  - Developed a Streamlit app, allowing users to input their preferences and get tailored headphone recommendations.

### [Project 4: Trick or ReTreat - Custom Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/simrenbasra/Trick_Or_ReTreat)
- **Description:** Developed a custom environment using Open AI's Gymnasium Library. Explored different training algorithms, including Q-learning and Deep Q-networks.
- **Technologies:** Python, PyGame, OpenAI Gymnasium, Stable Baselines 3
- **Highlights:**
  - Explored Open AI's Gymnasium and Stable Baselines 3 using the predefined Lunar Lander environment.
  - Progressed to building a custom Halloween-themed environment in an iterative approach:
      - _Phase 1:_ Simple Environment with a single reward.
      - _Phase 2:_ Intermediate Environment with a mix of static rewards and penalties.
      - _Phase 3:_ Final Environment, where penalties are positioned randomly at the start of each episode.
  - Built and trained the agent using the Q-learning algorithm.
  - Explored Deep Q-Networks to cope with the complexities of the final environment

### [Project 5: OLS Regression](https://github.com/simrenbasra/OLS_Regression)
- **Description**:  Implemented an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to predict price of cars. Includes data preprocessing, model building and performance evaluation.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Using classes I built to perform model building and data preprocessing for OLS regression.
  - Exploring effects of PCA
