## 🔍 Projects

### [Project 1: Sign-Lingual](#)
- **Description**: Developed a machine learning interpreter for American Sign Language (ASL). The project involves training and evaluating various models including Logistic Regression (with and without feature extraction), CNNs and Transfer Learning approaches like VGG-16 and ResNet-50, using both the MNIST dataset and real-world images.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Streamlit.
- **Highlights**:
  - Transfer Learning: Implemented VGG-16 and ResNet-50 to leverage pre-learnt feautures.
  - Model Comparison: Evaluated different models including Logistic Regression, CNNs, and Transfer Learning techniques to determine the most effective approach.
  - Data Augmentation: Enhanced model robustness by introducing noise and variability into the dataset.
  - Real-World Testing: Assessed models on images captured from real-world images using Teachable Machine.

### [Project 2: OLS Regression](#)
- **Description**:  Implemented an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to predict price of cars. Includes data preprocessing, model building and performance evaluation.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Using classess I built to perform model building and data preprocessing for OLS regression.
  - Exploring effects of PCA
