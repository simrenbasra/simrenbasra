## üîç Projects

### [Project 1: Sign-Lingual](#)
- **Description**: Developed a machine learning interpreter for American Sign Language (ASL). The project involves training and evaluating various models including Logistic Regression (with and without feature extraction), CNNs and Transfer Learning approaches like VGG-16 and ResNet-50, using both the MNIST dataset and real-world images.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Streamlit.
- **Highlights**:
  - Transfer Learning: Implemented VGG-16 and ResNet-50 to leverage pre-learnt feautures.
  - Model Comparison: Evaluated different models including Logistic Regression, CNNs, and Transfer Learning techniques to determine the most effective approach.
  - Data Augmentation: Enhanced model robustness by introducing noise and variability into the dataset.
  - Real-World Testing: Assessed models on images captured from real-world images using Teachable Machine.

### [Project 2: TimeSeries Forecasting of Microsoft Stock](#)
- **Description**: Developed a timeseries forecasting model for Microsoft stock prices using both baseline and advanced methods. The project includes data preprocessing, model implementation and evaluation using timeseries cross-validation.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, statsmodels, pmdarima, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Applied multiple forecasting models from baseline methods to exponential smoothing models to more advanced models like ARIMA.
  - Incorporated exogenous variables such as interest rates and trading volume into the SARIMAX model.
  - Used timeseries cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

### [Project 3: OLS Regression](#)
- **Description**:  Implemented an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to predict price of cars. Includes data preprocessing, model building and performance evaluation.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Highlights**:
  - Using classes I built to perform model building and data preprocessing for OLS regression.
  - Exploring effects of PCA
